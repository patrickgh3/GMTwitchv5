/*

Uses Twitch API v5, found at https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/

Read objTwitchGMExample for example usage.
All scripts also have documentation you can read.
IRC (chat) and the API are two separate interfaces. You can use one without the other if you wish.

Please note the stated IRC command and message limits in v5:
If you send more than 20 commands or messages to the server within 30 seconds, you will be locked out for 30 minutes.
If you send commands/messages only to channels in which you have Moderator or Operator status, the limit is 100 messages per 30 seconds.

It's recommended to use a separate bot Twitch account, and not your main personal account.
